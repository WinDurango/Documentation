8. The latest [release](https://github.com/WinDurango/WinDurango/releases)/[artifact](https://github.com/WinDurango/WinDurango/actions/workflows/msbuild.yml)

### To build

1. Everything from [the launch requirements](#to-launch) (except for the release/artifact)
2. Windows 10 (or later)
3. Windows App SDK
4. Visual Studio 2022
5. Git
6. Windows 11 SDK version 10.0.17134.0 or later
7. The following from the Visual Studio Installer
   - Desktop Development with C++
   - Windows Application Development
   - MSVC (143) C++ Build Tools
   - C++ (143) Universal Windows Platform Tools
   - .NET Desktop Development
   - Game Development with C++
8. The project cloned to a folder

## Running the package

To run the package, you need to setup the [Launch prerequisites](#to-launch) and have already [registered the package](#registering-the-uwp-package).   
You'll need to also copy in all the DLLs from the latest [release](https://github.com/WinDurango/WinDurango/releases)/[artifact](https://github.com/WinDurango/WinDurango/actions/workflows/msbuild.yml) into your app's Mount folder (the folder that has the EXE).  

After that, you just need to open the app through the start menu. (or other preferred way of running UWP apps)

## Registering the UWP package

You cannot normally run a UWP app's EXE file directly, instead you have to register the UWP app and launch it from the Start Menu/a Debugger.

1. [Enable Developer Mode](#enabling-developer-mode)
2. Go to the Mount folder of your game (where the EXE sits)
3. Open Powershell.exe to that directory
4. Run `Add-AppXPackage -Register .\AppxManifest.xml`

## Enabling Developer Mode

To register UWP apps, you have to enable Developer Mode.

1. Go to For Developers in Settings (path differs depending on Windows version, read below)
   - Settings > Windows Update > For Developers (Windows 10)
   - Settings > System > For Developers (Windows 11)
2. Enable Developer Mode
